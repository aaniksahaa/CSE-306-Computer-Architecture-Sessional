How to test?

1. In Logisim, open Circuit_Tester.circ 
2. 8 bit RAM needs less time, you may test with it
3. First generate 3 output hex files by running the script "tester.py"
4. Load 'x.txt', 'y.txt' onto two inputs and 'z.txt' onto the output RAM 
5. Adjust tick-frquency (4.1 kHz will be okay)
6. Click 'Enable Ticks' 
7. Run Simulation 
8. Analyze the file that is generated by the RAM that writes the comparison results
